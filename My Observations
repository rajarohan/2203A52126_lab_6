My observations on Linear regression , Lasso regression and Ridge regression are,

Training and Testing error in Linear Regression is,
(Train)Mean Squared Error: 2.0194839173657902e-28.
(Teasting)Mean Squared Error: 3.6350710512584225e-28.
Here training error is less than the testing error.

Training and Testing error in Ridge Regression is,
(Train)Mean Squared Error: 0.07851964168385524.
(Test)Mean Squared Error with Ridge Regression: 0.13283828848824786.
Here training error is very less than testing error.

Training and Testing error in Lasso Regression is,
(Train)Mean Squared Error: 0.3112545898437499.
(Test)Mean Squared Error with Lasso Regression: 0.11286936848958391.
Here testing error is less than training error.

Among these three models Lasso Regression has less error.
